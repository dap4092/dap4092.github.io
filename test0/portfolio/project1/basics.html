<h2>Status Conditions</h2>
<p>In addition to attacks that lower health, 
Pokemon are capable of using moves that inflict a variety status conditions.<br />
There are five main status effects that are worthing having an icon on the health bar. For some odd reason a pokemon can only be inflicted with one at a time.</p>
<p class="Conditions">Sleep</p>
<p>A sleeping pokemon cannot attack. It will wake up eventually. A sleeping pokemon is capable of using yawn and sleep talk if it knows the moves. Also vulnerable to dream eater.</p>

<p class="Conditions">Poison</p>
<p>A poisoned pokemon takes damage each turn. Can be inflicted by many poison type attacks. Some moves inflict badly poisoned status which doubles damage every turn. Poison and steel types cannot be poisoned.</p>

<p class="Conditions">Burn</p>
<p>A pokemon is essentially set on fire. Takes damage every turn and has lowered attack. Some fire type moves can inflict burn. Fire types cannot be burned.</p>
<img src="media/Burn_DP.png" height="192" width="256" title="How do you even burn a rock?." alt="A Geodude gets hurt by a burn." />
<p class="Conditions">Paralysis</p>
<p>The pokemon has its speed reduced to 25% of normal. In addition the pokemon has a 25% chance of beig uale to move. Some electric type moves inflict paralysis. Electric type pokemon are immune to this status effect. </p>
<img src="media/Paralysis_IV.png" height="192" width="256" title="Paralysis may not be the best word for this." alt="Paralysis prevents Sneasel from moving." />
<p class="Conditions">Frozen</p>
<p>A frozen pokemon is unable to move, though it may thaw out. A few ice moves can freeze, but it remains a low chance. Status cannot be inflicted in harsh sunlight. Getting hit by fire moves will thaw the pokemon, as will using certain fire moves. Ice type pokemon cannot be frozen. </p>

<p class="Conditions">Confusion</p>
<p>Unlike the above conditions, confusion is a secondary condition that can be inflicted while suffering from one of the above.A confused pokemon will hurt it self 50% of the time. When combined with paralysis, "parafusion" is an effective way of disaling an opponent's pokemon.</p>
